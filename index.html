            <h1>Help us protect the deers</h1>
            <p>Lately the deer population has been under a severe amount of pressure from
                a diverse range of problems, like global warming and excess hunting for example, our
                mission is to protect these precious creatures from this.

            <p>Deer's eyes are on the side of the head. This gives deer a wide vision angle of 310 
                and degrees making it almost impossible to focus on a focal point. They, however, have impressive night vision,
                which is essential during their feeding time and escape from predators.</p>

            <p>Deer practices both monogamy and polygamy. Since the breeding season is short for most species, 
                they also exhibit different characteristics, a male may have a territory that has one or more females, 
                several males may come together to protect a harem (female group) or just travel to different herds looking for mates.</p>

            <p>Fawns do not have a detectable smell. Predators are not able to pick up on the smell of 
                fawns which makes it easier to hide them. Mothers stay with the fawns for a period of 1-2 years, 
                while they are still feeding them, they hide them in safe areas and feed them up to 6 times during the day.</p>

            <p>Deer have special ways of communication. They communicate through visual, vocal, and chemical means. 
                They have a scent produced in various parts of the body that gives important information such as physique,
                sex, social status, and whether there is danger looming in an area.</p>
